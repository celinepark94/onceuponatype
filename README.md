# Welcome to Once Upon a Type!
The repository for Once Upon A Type, a web typography course running on hyperlink.academy 

## Using this Repo 

### Code Editor
1. Download a code editor. I like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download). If you have a code editor you prefer, great! Keep using what you're using. 
2. Open VS Code
3. In the top bar, View > Extensions
4. In the sidebar search for `Prettier - Code Formatter` and click + install the first result 
(Prettier is a nice plugin for VS Code that fixes your code formatting when you hit save. Must have for the beginner coder!)

### Cloning the repo 
We will go through this in a session together. Email me if you missed that session!

### Editing code 
1. Open VS Code
2. File > Open
3. Open the onceuponatype FOLDER (not just the file you want to edit)
4. In the side bar, find and open your file (onceuponatype > pages > your story title)
5. Make changes!

### Previewing your changes 
1. Open the page you want to see in your computer finder
2. Right Click > Open With > Firefox/Chrome/Whatever
3. This will open the page as a website
4. Whenever you make a change to the page in the code, save the code and refresh the website

### Adding your changes to the website
Do this exactly. The instructions will make sense as you follow them. If it doesn't work, get my attention and I'll help.
1. Open terminal (in VS Code, press ^ ~)
2. Make sure that no changes have happened since you last updated your code by typing in Terminal: `git pull origin master`
3. Then type: `git status` 
4. Check that it found all the changes you made correctly 
5. Then type: `git add *`
6. Then type: `git commit -m "write a short message about your changes"`
7. Then type: `git push origin master`
8. If should say "working tree clean" 
9. BOOM! All done!


BONUS: getting the most recent update: `git pull orgin master`
