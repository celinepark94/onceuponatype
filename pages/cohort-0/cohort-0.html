        There was a rabbit who asked a barber to shave him; in doing so the barber cut off his ear. “Take my ear,” said the rabbit, “and I will take your razors.”

        A little further on he saw an old woman pulling grass with her hands. “Take this,” he said, giving her the razor, “and cut grass with it, and I will take your cloth.”
        
        When she asked him why, he replied: “You have my razor and I have your chudder.”
        
        Then he went a little further and saw a ghee seller. “Take my chudder and give me your ghee,” said the rabbit. So saying, he left the chudder and walked off with the ghee.
        
        Not long after he met a woman, and told her to make him some goolgoolahs, or sweets, with the ghee. As soon as they were ready he picked them up and ran away. [60]
        
        A little further on was a man with a plough, a horse, and a bullock. “Take these sweets,” said the rabbit, “and I will yoke your plough for you.”
        
        But, instead of doing this, he ran away with the horse, and soon after met a marriage procession, in which the bridegroom was walking beside the bride’s litter or dooly. “Get on my horse: why do you walk?” said the rabbit gaily.
        
        So the man got on, and the rabbit ran off with the bride; but her husband ran after, and advised his wife to kill the rabbit.
        
        When they got to a quiet place, and rested under a tree, she asked the rabbit to let her comb his hair; but as soon as he put his head down, she gave him a severe knock on it, which stunned him, and then ran back to her husband. Thus ended the adventures of the rabbit.
